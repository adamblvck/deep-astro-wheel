# Deep Astro Wheel

We're trying to build a dataset with planetary positions as measured from Earth's positions.

Having done this, we want to look at some patterns. Could be anything, if it's worthy or special to notice or recognize.

Then we took following steps:

1. Build data set
  - Input (X) & Training (y): Julian Time + 4000 years of planetary positions
  - Validation (X -> Y) : Julian Time + 2000 years of unseen planetary positions
2. Train deep neural network on data
3. Validate against 2000 years of unseen planet positions
4. report
